BackgroundSplashPlugin
==================

This plugin allows the splashscreen to be shown when the app switcher is open.

This prevents unwanted users from looking at the content of your app.

Currently only working in iOS.

On iOS this plugin will try to show your splashscreen in the app switcher. It will search for splashscreens prefixed by `Default` or the value of the key `UILaunchImageFile` in your .plist file.
If it fails to find a splashscreen for a specific device or orientation (portrait or landscape), a black screen is shown instead.

Installation
------------

For Cordova 3.x.x:

1. To add this plugin just type: `cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-backgroundsplashplugin` or `phonegap local plugin add cordova-plugin-backgroundsplashplugin`
2. To remove this plugin type: `cordova plugin remove cordova-plugin-backgroundsplashplugin` or `phonegap local plugin remove cordova-plugin-backgroundsplashplugin`

Usage:
------

This plugin exposes no interface, it simply sets your app to be private. You don't need to do anything except install the plugin.

Test this plugin on a real device because the iOS simulator (7.1 at least) does a poor job hiding your app.
